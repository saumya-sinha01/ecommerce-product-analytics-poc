# PDP Redesign Experiment — Decision Summary

## Hypothesis
The redesigned PDP increases purchase conversion compared to the existing PDP.

## Methods
- A/B test (two-proportion z-test)
- 95% confidence intervals
- Logistic regression controlling for engagement

## Results
- Conversion lift: +0.63 pp (p = 0.65)
- 95% CI: (-2.06 pp, +3.33 pp)
- Regression treatment odds ratio: 1.40 (p = 0.35)

## Interpretation
While the treatment shows a directionally positive effect, results are not statistically significant. Both design-based and model-based analyses agree that the observed lift could be due to random variation.

## Decision
Do not ship globally. Recommend further iteration or targeted rollout pending additional data.
